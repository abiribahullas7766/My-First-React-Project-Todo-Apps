# Getting Started with Create React App
To run your React todo app on your PC, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your React todo app is located.

Use the cd command to change directories. 

For example, if your app is in a folder named todo-app, you would run:

bash

cd path/to/todo-app

Once you're in the app directory, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

npm install

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

npm start

The development server will compile your React app and open it in your default web browser. If it doesn't automatically open, you can access your app by entering the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:3000

You should now see your todo app running on your PC. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a reload of the app in the browser.
